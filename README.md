Vue Testing with Jest
=====================

*Description:*
This Repo follows my talk from the first Vue Conf in 2017.
You'll find the Slides and all code examples in here.
I tried to split them up in seperate files so they are quite followable.

## Run Specs Locally

In case you want to see all the specs running, clone or download the repository and open it in your terminal.

```shell
$ yarn install
```

will install all dependencies for you. After that you can run all specs like so:

```shell
$ yarn jest
```

## Getting started

Getting started with Jest is quite easy, so please check out the code snippets. Keep in mind though, the aim of this talk was an introductory one to testing and Jest it self and how to get started on your project.

If you have further questions or want to know about more advanced tasks with Jest, please ping me on Twitter [@Codebryo](https://twitter.com/Codebryo) or open an Issue and I'll try to come back on your questions.

Best,
Roman
